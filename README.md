## Introduction
Bellabeat is a technology company that designs and manufactures health-focused products exclusively for women. The company was founded in 2013 to collect and analyze data on women's activity levels, stress, sleep patterns, and overall health. This data enables women to make informed decisions about their health and habits. Bellabeat can become a significant player in the smart device market. In 2016, the company opened new offices and launched its products, which are available on its website (https://bellabeat.com/) and through online retailers. Bellabeat has invested in multiple media channels and has mainly focused on digital marketing, including popular platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Google Search.

### Business Task
The business task was to analyze smart device usage data to gain insights into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. Then, select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in the presentation. The business questions are:

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?

2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?

3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy?

#### Key Stakeholders
- **Ur≈°ka Sr≈°en**: Bellabeat's co-founder and Chief Creative Officer
* **Sando Mur**: Mathematician and Bellabeat‚Äôs co-founder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team
+ **Bellabeat marketing analytics team**: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting
data that helps guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy. I am in the role of a junior analyst on the team

#### Products
- **Bellabeat app**: The app provides users with data about their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits and helps people better understand their health and habits. The app connects to their line of smart wellness products.

* **Leaf**: a wellness tracker can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip. Leaf can connect with the Bellabeat app to track activity, sleep, and stress.

+ **Time**: A wellness watch can track activity, sleep, and stress and connect with the Bellabeat app. A watch provides you with insights about your daily wellness.
  
- **Spring**: A water bottle tracks daily water intake to ensure you are hydrated enough daily by applying state-of-the-art innovative technology. Spring can connect with the app and track your hydration level.

* **Bellabeat membership**: a subscription-based program for users with 24/7 access to fully personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health, beauty, and mindfulness-based on their lifestyle and goals.

# PREPARE
The data being used in this case study can be found here: [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data CC0](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit): Public Domain, dataset made available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic)

The data is stored and uploaded in R Studio. This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker data from thirty Fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users' habits.

The data set contains 18 CSV files organized in long format. Below is a breakdown of the data using the ROCCC approach:

- **Reliability - LOW**: The data comes from 30 Fitbit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. However, no demographic information is included.

- **Originality - LOW**: Third-party data collected using Amazon Mechanical Turk.

- **Comprehensive - MED**: The dataset contains multiple fields on daily activity intensity, calories used, daily steps taken, daily sleep time, and weight record. Data is within the parameters required for the Bellabeat‚Äôs business task

- **Current - LOW**: This data is from March 2016 through May 2016.

- **Cited ‚Äî LOW**: The third-party dataset was available by Mobius via Kaggle.

### Imports and Data Frames

```
## data frames
setwd("/cloud/project/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16")
getwd()
activity <- read_csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
calories <- read_csv("dailyCalories_merged.csv")
sleep <- read_csv("sleepDay_merged.csv")
steps <- read_csv("dailySteps_merged.csv")
weight <- read_csv("weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
heartrate <- read_csv("heartrate_seconds_merged.csv")
```
Now that I have imported all of the data frames I will be using, I am ready to start cleaning the data. I will take a look at each data frame to familiarize myself with the data and to check for errors. Below is a sample.
```
## Cleaning and exploring data
head(activity)
colnames(activity)
```
```
  Id ActivityDate TotalSteps TotalDistance TrackerDistance

5 1503960366    4/16/2016      12669          8.16            8.16
6 1503960366    4/17/2016       9705          6.48            6.48

```
While cleaning, I noticed some duplicate data and cleaned that, as well as changing everything to lowercase for ease.
```
sum(duplicated(sleep))
sleep <- unique(sleep)
activity <- rename_with(activity, tolower)
sleep <- rename_with(sleep, tolower)
```
Upon looking at the timestamp data, I noticed some problems. To solve this, I will convert it to date time format.
```
activity$activitydate=as.POSIXct(activity$activitydate, format="%m/%d/%Y", tz=Sys.timezone())
activity$date <- format(activity$activitydate, format = "%m/%d/%y")

sleep$sleepday=as.POSIXct(sleep$sleepday, format="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p", tz=Sys.timezone())
sleep$date <- format(sleep$sleepday, format = "%m/%d/%y")
```
# ANALYZE
To begin the analysis phase, I will first see how many participants there are in each category.
```
## Finding the number of participants in each category
n_distinct(activity$Id)  
n_distinct(calories$Id)   
n_distinct(steps$Id)
n_distinct(weight$Id)
n_distinct(heartrate$Id)
```
  
+ 33  

+ 33

+ 33

+ 8

+ 14

To summarize the above data, there are 33 participants in the activity, calories, and steps datasets,14 in heart rate, and only 8 in the weight dataset. The fact that there are only 8 participants in the weight dataset means that more data would be needed to make a strong recommendation or conclusion.

```
## Checking for significant changes in weight
weight%>%
  group_by(Id)%>%
  summarise(min(WeightKg),max(WeightKg))
```
```
# A tibble: 8 √ó 3

```
There are no significant changes in weight coming from these 8 participants. Due to the combination of low sample size and lack of variable change

### Statistical Observations
* The users spend an average of 991.2 minutes sedentary (idle), 16 hours and 52 minutes.

* The average number of steps per day is 7638. The CDC recommends people take 10,000 steps daily.

* The majority of the participants are lightly active.

* The average participant burns 97 calories per hour

* On average, participants sleep for 7 hours.

* The users burnt an average of 2304 calories

### Merging Data
Before visualizing the data, two of the datasets will be merged. I will inner join the activity and sleep datasets on columns ID and date.
```
#inner join sleep and activity

sleep_activity <- merge(sleep, activity, by = c('id', 'date'))
head(sleep_activity)
```
```

Judging from the scatter chart, there appears to be a correlation between the total number of steps taken and calories burned. Participants who take more steps tend to burn more calories.

```
ggplot(data = sleep, aes(x = totalminutesasleep, y = totaltimeinbed)) + geom_jitter() + labs(title = "Total Time Asleep vs Total Time In Bed")

We observed a positive correlation between the total time spent asleep and the total time spent in bed. To help users enhance their sleep quality, Bellabeat should consider allowing them to customize their sleep schedules for consistency.

```
ggplot(data = sleep_activity, mapping = aes(x = sedentaryminutes, y = totalminutesasleep)) +
  geom_jitter() + labs(title= "Sleep Duration and Sedentary Time")
```

By analyzing the chart above, we can observe that there is a negative correlation between SedentaryMinutes and TotalMinutesAsleep. Therefore, participants who are less active tend to get less sleep.

```
cor(sleep_activity$totalminutesasleep,sleep_activity$sedentaryminutes)
```
```
# -0.6010731
```
Let's investigate if our activity levels and sleep affect the day of the week.
```
# aggregate data by day of week to summarize averages
sleep_activity <- mutate(sleep_activity, day = wday(sleepday, label = TRUE))
summarized_activity_sleep <- sleep_activity %>%

### Insights Summary:

To provide a brief overview of the company's history: Bellabeat manufactures high-tech products focusing on women's health. By gathering data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health, Bellabeat has empowered women with information about their health and habits. Since its establishment in 2013, Bellabeat has experienced rapid growth and has quickly established itself as a technology-driven wellness company for women.

After analyzing data from the Fitbit Fitness Tracker, I have developed recommendations for a Bellabeat marketing strategy based on trends in smart device usage.
 
 1. As stated previously, the average number of daily steps is 7,638. This is lower than what the CDC recommends. According to the CDC's official publication (https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2016/pdf/16_0111.pdf), 8,000 steps per day was associated with a 51% lower risk for all-cause mortality (or death from all causes). Taking 12,000 steps daily was associated with a 65% lower risk than taking 4,000 steps. One thing Bellabeat can do is suggest that users take at least 8,000 steps per day and explain the benefits that come with it.

 2. The majority of participants are lightly active. Bellabeat should offer a progression system in the app to encourage participants to become at least reasonably active.

 3. Set daily reminders in the Bellabeat app. Notifications can remind users to log their data and encourage healthy habits and exercise.
 
 4. If users want to improve the quality of their sleep, Bellabeat should consider using app notifications to remind users to get enough rest and recommend reducing sedentary time.

 5. Participants are most active on Saturdays. Bellabeat can use this knowledge to remind users to go for a walk or jog that day. Participants are the least active on Sundays. Bellabeat can use this to motivate users to go out and continue exercising on Sundays.

 6. To ensure that our data is up-to-date, we suggest conducting a new survey and inviting at least 100 participants to share their health and habits on social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc. The survey will focus on females because Bellabeat products are designed for women. This will allow us to gather current data and analyze the latest trends in users' health and habits.
 
 7. Bellabeat could offer membership discounts to its customers based on the number of calories they burn through exercise. The Bellabeat app could track the amount of calories the user burns, which is then used to determine the discount percentage. The more calories customers burn, the more significant discount they will receive. By redeeming these discounts, customers can unlock more features to personalize their lifestyle design within the app. This incentive could motivate customers to exercise more to earn discounts and get the most out of the app.
